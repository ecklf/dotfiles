description: Generate context summary for new session
subtask: true
---

Generate a concise context summary of this session that can be used to bootstrap a new session. The summary should:

1. **Session Goal**: What was the main objective or task?
2. **Key Decisions**: Important choices made during the session
3. **Files Modified/Created**: List the relevant files that were changed or created
4. **Current State**: Where did we leave off? What's the current status?
5. **Next Steps**: Any pending tasks or known issues to address

Format the output as a markdown block that can be copy-pasted into a new session prompt. Keep it focused and actionable - include only information that would help continue the work effectively.

Output the summary in a fenced code block so it's easy to copy.
